7	O	You can almost hear the programmers at MTV crying out like Viacom s answer to Oskar Schindler that they could have done so much more to prevent just one more teen pregnancy Indeed who knows how many more births they might have prevented had they not featured Farrah Abraham who went to star in the porno Backdoor Teen Mom which doubtless increased sexual activity among teens The study is far less interesting for the specific claims it makes about teen birth rates than it is as a variation on persistent attitudes toward cultural production and consumption redolent of Frankfurt School anxieties over media s impact on the proletariat	featured	1	1	0
8	O	In many ways Media Influences on Social Outcomes is simply the latest echo of the idea that TV music movies novels and the like don t simply move audiences to laughter tears or contemplation but compel them to act in particular ways	is	1	0	1
9	O	The main difference here is that rather than fretting over increases in violent or sexual activity after watching TV the authors claim to document the most uplifting effect the boob tube has had since Fonzie got his library card on Happy Days and supposedly spurred a 500 percent increase in application requests nationwide	is	1	0	1

21	O	Especially in an age of DIY and on demand cultural production and consumption an age in which even the least engaged or conscious individual is able to decontextualize and recontextualize any piece of art in a way that would have absolutely blown Walter Benjamin s mind PDF the expressive view provides a more compelling and nuanced understanding of how we engage culture	is	1	1	1

35	O	More important weak labor market conditions as measured by the unemployment rate do appear to lead to lower teen birth rates and can account for 28 percent of the decline in teen birth rates since the Great Recession began	appear	0	0	1
36	O	In the new study they reiterate that a rotten economy tends to drive down birth rates When the labor market is weak they write teens like older women respond by having fewer children	reiterate	1	1	1
37	F	The effect is rather large as well a one percentage point increase in the unemployment rate reduces the teen childbearing rate by about 2 percent	is	1	1	0

39	O	While attributing a bigger share of the decline in the teen birth rate to a crap economy rather than low rent reality TV shows is obviously less likely to garner New York Times coverage it also demonstrates how the expressive understanding of culture works	demonstrates	1	1	1
