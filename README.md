# HITS-vs-Naive-Bayes
A comparison between classifying Opinions and Facts using the HITS algorithm and the Naïve Bayes classifier. 
Naïve Bayes is a classifier based on the Bayes theorem, and is one of the methods used for text categoraization. More information
can be found online.
HITS, on the other hand is an algorithm that is mainly used in Information Retrieval to estimate how well a page is linked to
another pages. It uses the fundamentals of HUBS and AUTHORITIES, where HUBS are the pages that point to other pages, and AUTHORITIES
are pages that are pointed to by many such hubs.
More information about HITS can be found online.

Implemented Naïve Bayes using the Weka API.
